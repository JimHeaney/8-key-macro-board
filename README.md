# 8 Key Macro Board

## Overview
The 8 Key Macro Board is a mechanical macro keyboard that can be programmed with nearly any combination of key presses. It is based around the 32u4 microcontroller, making it compatible with most open-source mechanical keyboard software. 

The first revision of this board was primarily made as a Reddit shortcut board, but I am now working on a version 2 that is better for general use.

## Current Release
Version 1.1

## Current State
The 8-Key Macro Keyboard is actively being developed to Version 2.0, that will include many significant changes.
